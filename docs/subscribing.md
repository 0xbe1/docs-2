# Subscribing to alerts

## Using Forta Explorer

You can subscribe to alerts generated by your agent using the [Forta Explorer subscriptions page](https://explorer.forta.network/notifications). You will first need to connect your Metamask wallet and sign a message to authenticate. Then you can create subscriptions to an agent ID or a contract address. Forta Explorer currently supports Slack and email notifications with more types of notifications coming in the near future.

Here is an example Slack notification:

As well as an example email notification:

## Using OpenZeppelin Defender

Alternatively, you could receive alerts using [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/), a security operations platform for Ethereum, which has even more types of notifications including email, Slack, Telegram and Discord. Check out their [Forta integration docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/sentinel) to learn more.

Once you have your alert subscriptions set up, you are ready to learn about [maintaining your agent](maintaining.md).
