# Governance

Forta has been a community-driven network from the beginning. Forta is currently governed by the Forta Foundation, an independent, non-profit organization. The Foundation provides a practical infrastructure that holds certain strategic off-chain assets (e.g. public IP and Github responsibilities) and will initially allow a governance council to formally make and execute governance decisions on behalf of the community until those decisions can be made directly on-chain in a safe, efficient and effective manner by the Forta community at large.
