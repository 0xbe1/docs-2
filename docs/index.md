# Overview

!!! important "Forta API (beta)"
    (February 2022) We recently launched API access to alerts. For more details, please check out [the API docs](api.md).

Welcome to the Forta Developer SDK documentation!

**Forta** is a decentralized, community-based monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems in real-time.

Given timely and relevant alerts about the security and health of owned or dependent systems, protocols and investors can react quickly to neutralize threats and prevent or minimize loss of funds.

Forta comprises of a decentralized network of independent **node operators** that scan all transactions and block-by-block state changes for outlier transactions and threats. When an issue is detected, node operators send alerts to subscribers of potential risks, which enables them to take action.

Leveraging Forta, developers can build **detection bots** and machine learning models, and run them on the decentralized Forta network to uncover anomalous activity on every blockchain transaction.

Forta will maintain a public registry of all alerts, and anyone interested in the security of a contract can consume relevant alerts via [Forta App subscriptions](https://app.forta.network/notifications), [Forta Explorer](https://explorer.forta.network/) or the [Forta API](api.md).

Anyone can develop a detection bot. Bots can currently be written using the [Javascript/Typescript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forta-agent) or [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/forta-agent/) and can be submitted for community feedback [here](https://discord.gg/2KaMS9wvPS).

Get started by [building your first bot](quickstart.md). Join our community [Discord](https://discord.gg/DUju5Dh4J9) for help and to chat with other developers and our team!

**Forta is currently in the public testnet phase**
