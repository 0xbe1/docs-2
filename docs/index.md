# Overview

Welcome to the Forta Developer SDK documentation!

Forta is a decentralized community-based security platform to prevent or mitigate smart contract exploits as they occur. We are currently in the private testnet phase. **Agents** are at the heart of the Forta network as they examine and flag events of interest. You can easily begin writing your own Forta Agents using the [Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forta-agent) or the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/forta-agent/).
