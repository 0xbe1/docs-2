# How to contribute

Thank you for being a part of Forta! We value and welcome all contributions from the community. As we have limited resources, getting the community involved is essential to Forta's success. There are several ways to contribute without having to write any code. Here are just a few ideas, but let us know if you have more!

## Join our Discord

One of the best ways to contribute is to just be a positive and helpful member of the [Forta Discord](https://discord.gg/DUju5Dh4J9) community. Participating in the conversation to help answer questions or contribute ideas/advice is extremely valuable. If you have a good understanding of Forta, helping others when they have a question or get stuck is an excellent way to grow the community.

## Spread the word

Runtime blockchain security is a relatively new concept and many people do not know they have such a tool available. If you know of a project that could really beef up their security, or has suffered a recent exploit or just needs to build a first line of defense, let them know about Forta! You can also share the Forta Agent development contests on your social media to get people involved and earn crypto prizes.

## Use the tools

[Forta Explorer](https://explorer.forta.network/) and [Forta Connect](https://connect.forta.network/) are essential tools that community members use to subscribe to alerts and deploy new agents. Helping test these tools by simply using them is a great way to contribute. See a bug or have an idea for improvement? Share it in Discord!

## Improve the documentation

Documentation is one of the most important parts of the Forta ecosystem as it onboards new members and helps users when troubleshooting. Going through the tutorials and reporting typos or parts that are confusing is a helpful way to contribute. This documentation site is opensource and [available on Github](https://github.com/forta-protocol/docs). See something missing? You can add to the docs by submitting a pull request against the repository (by forking it).

## Develop the SDK

Are you a skilled Javascript, Typescript or Python developer? You can help build out the Forta SDK and developer tools. The SDK and CLI are opensource and [available on Github](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-agent-sdk). Got an idea to improve the developer workflow? You can submit a pull request against the repository (by forking it). Reporting or fixing bugs and making suggestions for code improvements are also fantastic ways to contribute.

## Share useful libraries

Have you written an awesome library to help you develop agents? Sharing such tools and libraries helps the community also improve their agents. If you have identified a common pattern when writing your agents, you could share a set of templates that others can use to speed up their agent development process.

## Run a scan node (coming soon)

Scan nodes are a key piece of Forta infrastructure as they help run agents and share any alerts. A great way to expand the network is to run your own scan node and create bandwidth for more agents to run.
