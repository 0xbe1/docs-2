Registry of agents (known now as Detection Bots). Agents are abstract objects identified by a unique uint256 value. Agents are owned, transferable, and come with attributes:

- "metadata": string (in practice the ipfs hash of a descriptor)
- "chainIds": (sorted) array of integers

Both the metadata and the chainIds are mutable through the `updateAgent` function that is restricted to the agent's owner.

At every point in time, a metadata entry can belong to at most one agent (no two agents can share the same metadata entry).

Agents can be enabled / disabled either by their owner or by an admin (`AGENT_ADMIN_ROLE`). Each actor has independent "disable" flags:

- If an admin disables an agent, it takes an admin action to re-enable it (the owner cannot re-enable).
- Similarly, if an owner disables an agent, an admin cannot re-enable it.

If the agent Id is staked under the minimum stake, it canâ€™t be `enabled()` will return false, regardless of the flags.

As metadata are unique, it is possible for someone to front-run the creation/update of an agent by creating a new agent, or updating an existing one, to take over the metadata entry. This should be avoided by adding a commit-reveal scheme with a delay to both functions (`createAgent` and `updateAgent`). This has been disabled for now, but should probably be re-activated in the future.
