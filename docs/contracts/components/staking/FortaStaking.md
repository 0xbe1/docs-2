The FortaStaking contract is in charge of token staking in the Forta platform. The staking relies on an ERC20 token, that users (address) can stake on subjects (uint256). The subject doesn't need to perform calls, so arbitrary values could be used.
The subject semantics is defined for Agents and Scanners but open for future stakeholders. Since there is no way to know if agent ids, scanner ids, or future subject ids are unique in respect to each other, it is necessary to provide `subjectType` each time we refer to a subject to identify them.

- **Scanners Id**: address of the key pair generated by the Scanner Node Software, converted to uint256
- **Agents Id**: hashed UUIDv4 generated by agent SDK or Connect

Each subject has its own:

- **stake:** amount of ERC20 token brought by one or multiple users
- **shares:** that users get when they deposit stake. These shares are transferable (ERC1155 tokens) and can be burned to withdraw the corresponding amount of stake. Withdrawing however is subject to a delay.
- **reward pool:** ERC20 tokens that are rewarded to the share holders for a particular subject. This is split proportionally to each share holder's balance for the particular subject.

When a withdrawal is initiated, the corresponding stake and shares are "locked" during the withdrawal period. This allows an observer to differentiate between `activeStakeFor(address)` and `inactiveStakeFor(address)`. Similarly, it is possible to fetch `sharesOf(address,address)` and `inactiveSharesOf(address,address)`.

Unlike normal shares, inactive shares are not transferable. Both types of shared are ERC1155 tokenIds. To prevent collisions, we generate them like this:

- **Active share id**: `keccak256` of `subjectId` and `subjectType`, shifted 9 bits to the left, with bit 8 `set` and `subjectType` masked in bits 0-7
- **Inactive share id**: `keccak256` of `subjectId` and `subjectType`, shifted 9 bits to the left, with bit 8 `unset` and `subjectType`masked in bits 0-7

A `minimumStake` can be defined per subject. Is the role of the relevant components to define how that will affect the participation of each subjectType in the system

Addresses that have the `SLASHER_ROLE` can slash a subject. This will "seize" (part of) the stake, while not affecting the distribution of existing shares. Consequently, it makes each share less valuable. When a slashing even happens, both the active and inactive stakes are affected, meaning that initiating a withdrawal doesn't protect a user from slashing until the withdrawal process is complete.

The `SLASHER_ROLE` can also freeze/unfreeze a subject. This prevents any withdrawal of the subject under investigation. While a subject is frozen, shares are still transferable and withdrawal can still be initiated (but not finalized).

The withdrawal delay can be updated by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

When a slashing event happens, the seized tokens are transferred to the "treasury", which is an address that can be updated by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

When transferring shares, a user transfers the right over part of the stake and over future rewards. Past rewards are not affected by share transfers. If Anton has shares when Christina sends rewards, and Anton then decides to send its shares to Beatrice, Beatrice doesn't have any reward waiting for her, but Anton can still claim his share of Christina rewards even after he sends his shares.

## FortaStaking

_This is a generic staking contract for the Forta platform. It allows any account to deposit ERC20 tokens to
delegate their &quot;power&quot; by staking on behalf of a particular subject. The subject can be scanner, or any other actor
in the Forta ecosystem, who need to lock assets in order to contribute to the system.

Stakers take risks with their funds, as bad action from a subject can lead to slashing of the funds. In the
meantime, stakers are elligible for rewards. Rewards distributed to a particular subject&#x27;s stakers are distributed
following to each staker&#x27;s share in the subject.

Stakers can withdraw their funds, following a withdrawal delay. During the withdrawal delay, funds are no longer
counting toward the active stake of a subject, but are still slashable.

The SLASHER_ROLE should be given to a future smart contract that will be in charge of resolving disputes.

Stakers receive ERC1155 shares in exchange for their stake, making the active stake transferable. When a withdrawal
is initiated, similarly the ERC1155 tokens representing the (transferable) active shares are burned in exchange for
non-transferable ERC1155 tokens representing the inactive shares.

ERC1155 shares representing active stake are transferable, and can be used in an AMM. Their value is however subject
to quick devaluation in case of slashing event for the corresponding subject. Thus, trading of such shares should be
be done very carefully.

WARNING: To stake from another smart contract (smart contract wallets included), it must be fully ERC1155 compatible,
implementing ERC1155Receiver. If not, minting of active and inactive shares will fail.
Do not deposit on the constructor if you don&#x27;t implement ERC1155Receiver. During the construction, the minting will
succeed but you will not be able to withdraw or mint new shares from the contract. If this happens, transfer your
shares to an EOA or fully ERC1155 compatible contract._
