# Deploying your agent

Once you have tested your agent locally, you are ready to deploy it to the Forta protocol production environment! Deploying your agent involves 2 key steps:

1. publishing a Docker image, and
2. registering it in the Agent Registry contract.

You can choose to [deploy using Forta Connect](deploying-connect.md) (recommended), or [deploy using the CLI tool](deploying-cli.md). With the Forta Connect dapp, less configuration is required and your deployment will be gasless. You may still want to use the CLI tool, for example, in your CI/CD pipeline.
