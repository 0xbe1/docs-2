# Deploying your agent

Once you have tested your agent, you can deploy it to the Forta network using the `forta-agent publish` command (or `npm run publish`). This will build a Docker image for your agent and push it to an image repository where scan nodes can find it. A manifest will be generated for your agent (which includes a reference to the image) and be published to the Agent Registry contract.

This requires some configuration to be set in your forta.config.json. Firstly, you will need to specify the `agentId` of your agent which should be globally unique. You should also set the `version` of your agent to track changes. A `documentation` markdown is provided as an example, which should be updated for your specific agent.

The Agent Registry contract is currently deployed on the Göerli testnet, so you will need to send a “publish” transaction to the Agent Registry (using the `forta-agent publish` command). To do this you will need Göerli ETH in your account generated by the `init` command (you can get some at [https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog](https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog)).

Access to an IPFS gateway is required to publish your agent’s manifest. The manifest will be stored on the IPFS network, and the IPFS address of the agent manifest will be published to the Agent Registry contract. This will be used by Forta scan nodes to pull the image for your agent and execute it. We recommend using the [Infura IPFS gateway](https://infura.io/docs/ipfs) as the simplest option to interact with IPFS. The `ipfsGatewayUrl` will point to the IPFS gateway you want to use (for Infura, this would be `https://ipfs.infura.io:5001`). If your gateway requires an authorization header (as Infura’s does), you can set this value using the `ipfsGatewayAuth` property (e.g. `Basic Base64(<YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID>:<YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_SECRET>)`).

Lastly, you need to provide the `agentRegistryJsonRpcUrl` which should be a JSON-RPC endpoint to access Göerli. We also recommend using Infura to do this e.g. `https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`

!!! note "Signing the manifest"
    The agent manifest will need to be signed using your keyfile generated by the `init` command (you will be prompted for password).

Once your agent is published and picked up by a scan node, you can view the findings it generates using the [Forta Explorer](https://explorer.forta.network/).

Congrats! You have created a project, developed an agent, written and run a test, and deployed it to the Forta network.

We encourage you to share your agents with the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/DUju5Dh4J9) as a way to showcase your ideas or receive general feedback! For any questions or feedback you may have, you can find us in the [Forta Discord server](https://discord.gg/DUju5Dh4J9) as well.
